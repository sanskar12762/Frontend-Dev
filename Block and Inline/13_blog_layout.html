            <h2>Things I Learned This Week</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-10-13">October 13, 2025</time>
            <p>This week has been incredibly productive! I learned about HTML5 semantic elements, practiced creating structured web pages, and discovered the importance of proper documentation. The more I code, the more I realize how much there is to learn and explore in the world of technology.</p>
